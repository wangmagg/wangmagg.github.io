I'm a third year PhD student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University and am fortunate to be advised by [Mike Baiocchi](https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-baiocchi). I work on experimental design methodology for evaluating the causal effects of interventions that target behaviors and mindsets. I especially care about interventions in the health and healthcare spaces, including empowerment self-defense programs that equip women and girls with skills to resist sexual assault and machine learning-based clinical support tools that help physicians make better decisions for their patients.

Previously, I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University. I am grateful for several research mentors I had the privilege of working with prior to coming to Stanford: [Michael Miller](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/michael-i-miller/) at the [Johns Hopkins Center for Imaging Science](https://www.cis.jhu.edu/), [Sharon Hori](https://profiles.stanford.edu/sharon-hori?tab=bio) at the [Stanford Canary Center for Early Cancer Detection](https://canarycenter.stanford.edu/), and [Alain Trouv√©](https://atrouve.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) at the [ENS Paris-Saclay Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en).



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

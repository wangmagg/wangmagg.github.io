I'm a fifth year PhD student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University and am fortunate to be advised by [Mike Baiocchi](https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-baiocchi). 

I work on experimental design methodology for evaluating the causal effects of interventions that target behaviors and mindsets. I especially care about measuring the impact of interventions in the public health and healthcare spaces, including empowerment self-defense programs that equip women and girls with skills to resist sexual assault and machine learning-based clinical support tools that help physicians make better decisions for their patients.

Previously, I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University. Before Stanford, I am grateful to have worked with [Michael Miller](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/michael-i-miller/) at the [Johns Hopkins Center for Imaging Science](https://www.cis.jhu.edu/), [Sharon Hori](https://profiles.stanford.edu/sharon-hori?tab=bio) at the [Stanford Canary Center for Early Cancer Detection](https://canarycenter.stanford.edu/), and [Alain Trouv√©](https://atrouve.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) at the [ENS Paris-Saclay Centre Borelli](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en).
